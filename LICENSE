For anyone who wants to or already is a vim enthusiast

Feel free to ask questions, open issues, submit pull requests, and whatever else.
I encourage contributions to creating the ultimate vim.
Also, if it doesn't work(it should) or breaks things(it shouldn't) I am not responsible for it.

Alot of the stuff here I have learned from other similar vimmers and built around my own uses for what I think is best based on experience and use.

Enjoy!
