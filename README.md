Yo what's up!

Here is my vim config, one of the most important things to a CS or Software Engineer is their editor.

I just wanted to share this with others to either hopefully give them a good start on their own or just so they don't have to go through the hassel of making one.

Some Mapping notes for those crazy customizers:

![Vim mappings and what they mean](vim_mappings.png?raw=true "Vim Mappings")

Enjoy!

Also: I ***strongly*** suggest you install the [FiraCode font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) from https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode and set your terminal to use it.  It is the best font I have ever found and is well optimized to look nice on all screens.  It even works inside of VSCode and its terminal!  (Also supports powerline).
